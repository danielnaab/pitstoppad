Previously, Pinax's user account management was being used, but it was ripped out to simplify the codebase and dependencies.  In the future, Facebook connect will be used for authentication.  For now, log in using the admin account created during `syncdb` at http://localhost:8000/admin, then go to http://localhost:8000.
